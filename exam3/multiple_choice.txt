Objects of type iterator promise to implement each of the following
except:

Choices:
   a. `operator=`
   b. All of these are implemented in an iterator.
   c. `operator*`
-> d. `operator+`
   e. `operator==`
Your answer was correct.

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Consider the following code:

    #include <iostream>
    using namespace std;

    class dunno
    {
        public:

        int operator()(int f){
            return f>0 ? f : -f;
        }
    };

    void main()
    {
        float f = -123.45;
        dunno aObj;
        int something_f = aObj(f);
        cout << "f = " << f << " something_f = " << something_f << endl;
    }

What happens when you run the above code?

Choices:
-> a. `f = -123.45 something_f = 123.45`
   b. None of these is the correct output.
   c. Compilation error
   d. `f = 123.45 something_f = -123.45`
   e. Runtime error
Your answer was incorrect.

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Fill in the blanks so that the following sentence is true: If you have a
complete tree with 17 nodes, the maximum height ($h$) of the tree is
\_\_\_\_\_\_ and there are \_\_\_\_\_\_ nodes on level $h$.

Choices:
   a. First blank is 4, second is 1.
   b. First blank is 8, second is 2.
-> c. None of the other options makes the sentence true.
   d. First blank is 5, second is 2.
   e. First blank is 8, second is 9.
Your answer was correct.

-> b. `995, 353, 254, 498, 223`
   c. `492, 125, 418, 197, 223`
   d. `128, 735, 209, 245, 223`
   e. None of the options is correct.
Your answer was correct.

Suppose we remove the node containing key 10 from the AVL tree below.

    8 -> {
        5 -> {
            3 -> {
                1 -> {,2},
                4
            },
            6 -> {,7}
        },
        10 -> {
            9,
            12 -> 11
        }
    }

What sequence of rotations will restore the balance of the tree? (Assume
IOP is used for 2-child removal.)

Choices:
   a. None of these choices will rebalance the tree.
   b. `leftRotate` about 9, followed by `rightRotate` about 8.
   c. `rightRotate` about 8.
-> d. `rightLeftRotate` about 9, followed by `rightRotate` about 8.
   e. `leftRotate` about 12, followed by `rightRotate` about 8.
Your answer was correct.

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Suppose we would like to build a dictionary that maps a set of student
names (short strings) to a study group identifier. Which of the
following would work as a key function for our dictionary?

*Hint: the ordering of the students in the original set should not
matter.*

Choices:
-> a. None of the other answers are correct.
   b. Sort the students' names and then sum the values of the characters in
      their names.
   c. Sort and then concatenate the first letters of the students' names.
   d. Sort each name by character, then form a concatenation of all the sorted
      names.
   e. Concatenate the names.
Your answer was correct.

Choose the appropriate running time from the list below.

The variable $n$ represents the number of items (keys, data, or key/data
pairs) in the structure. In answering this question you should assume
the best possible implementation given the constraints, and also assume
that every array is sufficiently large to handle all items (unless
otherwise stated).

Find the minimum key in a Binary Tree (need not be a BST)

Choices:
   a. $O(n^2)$
   b. $O(n\log n)$
   c. $O(1)$
-> d. $O(n)$
   e. $O(\log n)$
Your answer was correct.
